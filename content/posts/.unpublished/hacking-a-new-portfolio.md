Developing a portfolio can be a daunting task. I'm almost never satisfied. I can never call it "done". However, I recently found a way to hack the process and get myself over the hump. It all starts with someone else's HTML (that you purchase).

## Design
The most difficult part has always been settling on a design. It may be that I don't spend enough time planning and thinking about the colors, fonts, and overall brand. I, like many developers, just want to build. Most of the time, when I set out to build a portfolio I end up frustrated at the early stages of design.

Recently, I started taking inventory of all the HTML templates I've purchased over 10 years of various needs on ThemeForest. I stopped at a multi-purpose template that had modern, not so cheesy characteristics (I have to admit, a lot of the themes out just feel cheesy). This particular version of the do-it-all theme was photography-based and utilized a color scheme that I found clean, but different.

## Implementation
So I found a design that I liked - but I'm a developer. I want to play with shiny, new (to me) frameworks and technologies. With the HTML and design mentioned above, I reached for Nuxt.js (because I'm working in Vue right now). At first, you can throw together Vue components with the HTML from the design. As I progressed through the various pages as well as my needs I began extracting components out.
