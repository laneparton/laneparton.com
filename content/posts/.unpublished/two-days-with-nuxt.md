## Introduction
Two days ago I ventured deeper into the Vue.js community. Until now, my role at Xylem has only involved building within the confines of a Vue 2 SPA. It was classic timing. I needed a new portfolio and I needed to spend some time within the Vue ecosystem. With that - I reached for Nuxt 3.

## What I'm Happy With
### Opinionated
Discussing how Nuxt 3's opinionated approach has made development smoother for the author.
### Dynamic Imports
Highlighting the benefits of dynamic imports in Nuxt 3 and how they have improved the author's workflow.
### nuxt/content & nuxt/image
enhanced content management and image handling

## Where I Struggled
### Fundamentals
### Documentation
### runtimeConfig and process.env

## Conclusion
Is it perfect? Absolutely not. Do I have a long list of [TODO]()? Yes, yes I do.
