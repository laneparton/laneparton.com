When team’s annual budget was approved I was greeted with a career development trip to Oakland for DeveloperWeek 2020. As exciting as it is, it’s also a bit unnerving. This will be my first developer conference outside of North Carolina and my **first ever hackathon**. That said, I believe I’ll bring some frontend/design knowledge to my hackathon team, whoever they may be :)

## An Abundance of Learning Opportunities

Obviously I’ll be following the [JavaScript](https://developerweek2020.sched.com/overview/type/JavaScript+Conference) track as its the most relative to my experience, but I’m equally excited to jump into a number of sessions from other tracks. One of the other tracks I found in my schedule was [ProductWorld](https://developerweek2020.sched.com/overview/type/ProductWorld+(PRO+WORKSHOPS+&+SESSIONS)). [ProductWorld](https://developerweek2020.sched.com/overview/type/ProductWorld+(PRO+WORKSHOPS+&+SESSIONS)) features a number of UI/UX dicussions along with insights into team management and collaboration. I hope to walk out of this conference with not only a deeper knowledge of technical execution but also new perspectives on strategy, management, and team collaboration.

## My Top 5 Talks

1. [Lessons Learned Porting 100k Lines of Code to Typescript](https://developerweek2020.sched.com/event/YGds/pro-session-lessons-learned-porting-100k-lines-of-code-to-typescript)
2. [Save Weeks of Coding: The Strategy, Design and Functional Value of Engineering Blueprints](https://developerweek2020.sched.com/event/YJqw/keynote-twilio-save-weeks-of-coding-the-strategy-design-and-functional-value-of-engineering-blueprints)
3. [Porting a JS Library into a React Component](https://developerweek2020.sched.com/event/Y7EH/pro-session-porting-a-js-library-into-a-react-component)
4. [Modern React Design Patterns](https://developerweek2020.sched.com/event/YF7T/pro-session-modern-react-design-patterns)
5. [Progressive Web Apps Are the Future](https://developerweek2020.sched.com/event/YF7q/pro-session-progressive-web-apps-are-the-future)

## A Sneak Peak at the Hackathon

While I’m nervous about the [hackathon](https://www.developerweek.com/events/hackathon/), I also understand that preparation and planning will push me to bring the value my team deserves. In my next post, I’ll outline the known challenges from each sponsor and strategize/brainstorm some solutions.
