## Goals:
1. Finalize Basic Company Data
   1. What data do I need to support?
   2. Fetch basic company information
2. Strategy for ranking social media sentiment? What am I actually able to accomplish?
   1. APIs?
   2. How do people rank results that get returned?
      1. Keywords?

## Notes:
### Data/Modeling
- Company Information:
  - Name
  - Ticker
  - Description
  - Market Cap
  - Website
  - Employee Count
  

### Client Work
  - Created Header - Opted for "use client" - primarily for active class on the links, but maybe I need it for more later?
  - Created Initial Company Archive
  - Created Initial Company Details
    - Tested HackerNews Algoli API - not sure how I want to query it to get the information I'm after.

### Server Work
  - Decided to Add the Slug to the DB (not sure if this is a great idea or not)

## TODO - Next Steps
- Should I move the Pocketbase import into a hook? Can I check for the data before I attempt to load it?
  - Do I really care about the future of the initial data import? Will I use backups or exports moving forward?
- Strategy for ranking social media sentiment? What am I actually able to accomplish?
   1. APIs?
   2. How do people rank results that get returned?
      1. Keywords?
