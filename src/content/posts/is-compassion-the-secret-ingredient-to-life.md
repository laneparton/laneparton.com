I've been listening to Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris recently and I stumbled across the idea of compassion. I think of myself as a pretty average person - I know what compassion means. I know what moments of compassion feel like, but have I ever tried to actively be compassionate in my everyday experiences? No, I don't think so.

From my brief research and basic understanding, compassion at its core is a connection and a concern for others. Being compassionate is a central part of being a human and I'm not so sure I've put compassion first, ever. I've been searching lately for purpose, meaning, a mission, etc but I'm starting to consider that I may have been looking in the wrong places (although that introspection has led me here). What would change if I thought more about the feelings of others? How would I enact such a change?

I *think* the answer is in meditation. I've dabbled in meditation time and time again, but I have never fully committed to making it a consistent force in my life. Outside of meditation, I think there needs to be a commitment to actively thinking about others and how they feel in certain circumstances. More specifically, imagine how powerful compassion could be in the work environment. If I actively considered the feelings of my coworkers - would I respond the same as before? Could I soften my tone and strengthen my delivery?

This is a journey and I'm only at the beginning. I want to point out one of the most important resources behind this exploration: [The Dalai Lamaâ€™s Guide to Happiness](https://www.tenpercent.com/courses/happiness). I've thoroughly enjoyed learning more about The Dalai Lama and the ideas he offers Dan Harris (and others) in this series of videos and meditations.
